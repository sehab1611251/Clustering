# Clustering
In this clustering problem, I have implemented three Unsupervised Machine Learning algorithms: the Mixture of Gaussians, Mean Shift, and Normalized Cut, and explained the difference between the three models. These algorithms were implemented on the handwritten digits MNIST dataset.


Below are the results and differences between these models:
### 1. Mixture of Gaussians
